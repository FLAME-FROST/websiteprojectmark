Longing in being alone

































































Am I disturbing you?
Am I disturbing your inner peace?
Am I disturbing your Leisure time?
Should I stop chatting you?
If you really feel Uncomfortable please block me..
I just hate being ignored kasi eh..haha..
I know You have your own decisions but can't you just see or read my messages when You're Online?




Pssst, crush,, I know you are in your last year na so I think disturbing you might be a bad thing,, Sa tingin ko nadisdistorbo lang kita sa pangarap mo, di ko napansin/o naisip yon.. so sorry for disturbing you po.. Sana balang araw, Pagnaabot mo na pangarap mo,, pwede na kitang kulitin hahahaha.. 11,06,2022 Sunday 



















Realizations:
Take the risk
Drop the towel kasi wala namang mawawala. you start with nothing. maybe that nothing will become something. or it will stay as nothing.

You begin with Nothing. Maybe that Nothing will become Something or it will stay as Nothing.. which means walang mawawala.. Just don't put all the eggs in one basket..


When it comes to relationships:
If you like someone. try to know her. Take the risk. What can he/she do if nalaman niya na you like her diba. As long as it didn't/will not harm someone, then it's good.

Don't get too attach.. Just court him/her without expecting in return. Chat her atleast 1 month. 2 months if medjo comfortable na siya sayo. kung feel mo na wala paring development within that 1 month then Stop.. If you feel na di siya comfortable or anything then stop. If you feel na nakakadistorbo ka lang then stop.. If feel mo na di siya nagexpress ng emotion niya like magalit, mainis, masaya, then stop. If she doesn't have any emotions like she ignored you, then stop.












































I feel lonely and alone
I feel disappointed dahil iba InADD niya, hindi ako
I want to be alone
I want to not socialize for a month or two
I wanna heal
I don't need friends if they don't feel thesame
I don't need friends if they are not thoughtful about me
I don't need friends if they do not care
I don't need friends if they are fake
